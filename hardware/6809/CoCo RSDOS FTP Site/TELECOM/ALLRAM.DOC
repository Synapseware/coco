                  Brief *ALL RAM* BBS Operating Instructions:       Documentation and Programs Copyright (C) 1983 by Allen C. Huffman                           Public Release:  May 1988The *ALL RAM* BBS System requires a 32k+ Extended Basic CoCo to operate andconsists of two programs:  EDITOR, and *ALLRAM*.  (An auto-answer modem, and aremote driver such as REMOTE2 from The Rainbow, is also required for on-lineoperation.)STARTING UP:The first thing you will have to do is create the userlog and message basefiles that the BBS requires in order to run.  Load in the first program,EDITOR, and run it. You will see some garbage on the top left of the screen fora few seconds before the menu appears.  This is a short M/L routine temporarilystored on the screen that does a PCLEAR 0 to clear out space for the systemfiles.Select option #1 (Create Userlog), then enter the name of the SYStem OPerator. Next, enter the password you will use to access the system.  If you typed ineverything correctly, type "Y" at the verify prompt, otherwise type "N" andretry.You will now have to save the userlog to tape.  Do this by using option #3(Save Userlog/Message Base) from the main menu.  Insert a blank tape, or usethe back side of the tape the BBS is on, and get it ready to save.  (IE, getpast the leader, press record and play.)  Then press ENTER and the userlog willbe saved to tape along with the empty message base.  Use option #8 to exit tobasic.RUNNING THE BBS:Load and run the second program, *ALLRAM*.  You will once again see the garbageon the screen followed by a promt asking you to ready the data tape forloading.  Rewind the tape with the system files on it and press play.  Now hitENTER and the BBS will load in the userlog and message base, then start up.USING THE BBS:The start up screen will display the name of the system, how many users are onthe system, how many calls have been made to the BBS, and a promt waiting for acaller to logon and press ENTER.Press the ENTER key and a short tone will sound alerting you that the system isactive.  The system will then identify itself and ask for a password.  If youdon't have a password, type in the word "NEW" or press ENTER, then fill out thepassword application form.If you want to logon as SysOp, type in the password you enetered when you werecreating the userlog.  The system will search for that password, and if it doesnot find it, you will be asked to try again.  After three invalid entries, theBBS will hang up on the caller and reset.Once your password has been found, your user status will be displayed and youwill be sent to the main menu.BBS FUNCTIONS:Selecting "?" at the menu prompt will display all the BBS functions:C-all SysOp:  alerts the SysOp that a user wishes to type to him.  (Pressing    CLEAR will enter the chat mode, and typing BYE at the start of a line will    exit back tothe main menu.)G-oodbye:  bids the caller farewell, then resets the system.U-serlog:  tells how many users are on the system, then displays their names    and access levels.  (Novalidated users [level 0] cannot use this option.)P-ost Message:  allows a user to leave a message to others.  You will be asked    to whom the message is to, and if it is private.  If the message is not    private, you will be asked for the subject, or title, of the message.  You    will then be allowed to type in up to 10 lines/64 characters each.  If you    want to stop before the 10 lines are up, hit ENTER on a blank line.  After    this, you will be sent to the message editor, which is self-explanitory.    (Nonvalidated users cannot use this option.)R-ead Messages:  allows a user to read messages from others.  Enter the    message number you would like to read or press ENTER to return to the main    menu.  Private message can only be viewed by the sended, receiver, or    SysOp.  (Nonvalidated users cannot use this option, either...)S-can Titles:  lists the message titles and who they are to.SYSOP FUNTCTIONS:% - Entering "%" from the main menu will shut down the BBS.  Only the SysOp(Level 9) can use this function.  You will be asked to enter a password.Carefully type in "?DROWSSAP" and press ENTER.  If you enter the wrongpassword, you will be sent back to the main menu.  If the password is enteredcorrectly, you will be asked if you want to abort the BBS.  Type "YES" and youwill be asked to ready the data tape.  Follow the same instructions as you didwith the editor.  After the files are saved, you will drop into basic.  (% MUSTbe used in order to update the system files daily.)EDITORMost of the editor functions are self-explanitory, but before you can doanything, you must load in the system files by using option #2 (LoadUserlog/Message Base).After the files have been loaded, you may kill individual messages by usingoption #7 (Kill Messages), print out the userlog or messages by using option #4(Print Messages) and #4 (Print Userlog), or edit and validate users with #6(Edit Userlog).Editing users is failry easy.  Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll throughthe userlog.  When you get the user you want, you may D-elete him (the SysOp,user #0, cannot be deleted), or E-dit him.  When editing, type in the new data,or press ENTER to leave it unchanged.  J-unp allows you to go to a specifieduser, and M-enu returns you to the editor menu.Be sure to save (#3) the edited files back to tape before you quit (#8), or allyou editing will be in vain.CONCLUSION:That's about all you should need to know for now.  More detal will be includedon system commands and customization in the complete documentation.  Below aresome of the special features that I have not mentioned yet.Auto Log-Off:  After 150 inputes, the system will display a message asking theuser to finish up soon.  After 200 inputs, the system hangs up on him thenresets.System Levels:  Level 0 is assigned to new users.  (0=Nonvalidated.)  You mayvalidate users by giving them a level of 1, or make them a SysOp by giving thema level 9.  It is, however, unwise to give any user level 9 since no specialfeatures are installed for the SysOp to use on-line.  The only specialprivillige would be the reading of private messages.Lower Case Conversion:  A routine that converts lower case to upper case isused from time to time to allow the BBS to respond to lower case input.Upper/Lower Output:  Most of the output to the callers is in upper andlowercase to enhance the look of the system to outside callers with terminalprograms that can handle lower case.Future modifications to this system include software time, which will remainaccurate since no I/O is used during on-line operations, and chat mode toggle(ON/OFF), as well as possible activity files written out to tape, and, last butnot least, disk adaptions to allow many message bases and extra disk commands.SPECIAL NOTES:This program requires a remote driver (not included) in order to operateonline.  REMOTE2 from Rainbow magazine is recommended since it does the job andis free.  Simply clear memory (as the REMOTE2 instructions say) before loading,then load and run the *ALLRAM* program and you will be set.  You will have toadd any special modem hang-up command in the logoff routine.MORE SPECIAL NOTES:This program was orignally written back in 1983 and would have been marketed bya major software firm, but that deal never saw the light of day.  As a result,I have kept the program stashed away over the years.  I tried to have itdistributed in 1985 through another software house, but they went out ofbusiness shortly before a deal could be made.  Rainbow was another option, butinstead I decided to make it ShareWare to anyone who wants it!  This programdoes prove, once and for all, that it IS possible to run a BBS without a diskdrive even though all the main sources say it isn't!This program is ShareWare, but I do not require any kind of donation.  Justwrite me a letter if you use this program, or write if you have any questionsor comments.  My current address is:               Allen C. Huffman               110 Champions Dr. #811               Lufkin, TX 75901By the way, a "registered" version of this BBS (1988) is being written thatwill have a larger message base, more bells and whistles (New message read,system clock, and much, much more!) as well as a souped up editor and expandeddocumentation file.  When this is completed, it will be available for a smallfee, probably around $10-$15 and will be sent to you on tape with a printedinstruction sheet.  Interested?  Write me a letter and let me know!I hope this program reaches at least one person that it can help.  I wrote itdue to a desire to run a BBS, and since I lacked the "3 to 4 disk drives" thatall of the systems required back then.  Unfortunately, or fortunately,depending on how you look at it, drives are now so affordable that is is justas easy to buy one a run a much larger system.  The reason I still persue thissoftware venture is because there still are requests to run a tape-based BBSsystem from time to time in The Rainbow, and on other BBS systems.  Until now,the anwer was a flat "NO, is just ain't possible".  I can finally change that.Enjoy, and let me know what you think of my bare-bones, very limited, but atleast it works on tape, BBS.                                 
