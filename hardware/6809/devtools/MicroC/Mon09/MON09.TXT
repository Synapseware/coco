    MON09                                                            Page: 1


    1. INTRODUCTION

          MON09 is an interactive software  debugger  and  machine  language
       monitor  for  the   motorola   6809   microprocessor.   It   contains
       display/alter memory/register facilities,  as well  as  a  full  6809
       disassembler,  breakpoint,  and  software  single   step   functions.
       Download and transparent communication modes are also included.

          MON09  requires  no  hardware  assist,  all  functions   including
       single-step are implemented in the  MON09  firmware.  MON09  requires
       three  user  supplied  subroutines  for  interfacing  to  the  system
       hardware. The required routines are as follows:

         INIT - Initializes a serial port (uart).  The address of the device
                to initialize is passed in the 'X'  register.  All processor
                registers may by modified.

         READ - Test for a character from the uart (address in 'X'),  and if
                found, return it in ACCA, with the 'Z' flag set.  Otherwise,
                return with $FF in  ACCA,  and  'Z'  flag  clear.  No  other
                registers may be modified.

        WRITE - Writes the character in ACCA to the uart  (address in  'X').
                The 'B' and 'X' registers only may be modified.

          MON09 requires 160 bytes of read/write memory,  for  stack,  local
       variables,  buffers etc,  and about 5900 bytes of ROM memory for  the
       program.  If MON09 is placed in an 8K (2764 or compatable) rom,  this
       will leave over 2k of space for the user I/O routines.  The MON09 rom
       must be at the top of the 6809 memory map,  as it has to control  the
       6809 interrupt vectors.

    2. USING MON09

       2.1 Operand format

        Anywhere that MON09 expects an 8 bit value, you may use:

            Two HEX digits                              Eg: 1F
            A QUOTE followed by an ASCII character      Eg: 'a

        Anywhere that MON09 expects a 16 bit value, you may use:

            Four HEX digits                             Eg: 09AB
            ASCII characters preceeded by quotes        Eg: 'a'b
            X, Y, U, P, or S for current CPU register   EG: X

       2.2 Monitor Commands

             The following commands are implemented in the monitor.

               B <breakpoint#> <address>

                  Set breakpoint at specified address. Breakpoint is removed
                  if address is 0000.  There can be up to eight breakpoints,
                  which are referenced by the numbers 0 to 7.

               CR <register> <value>

                  Changes  6809  registers  values.  Register  is  a  single
                  character, which may be as follows:

                  A   - Set A accumulator (8 bit value).
                  B   - Set B accumulator (8 bit value).
                  C   - Set condition code register (8 bit value).
                  D   - Set direct page register (8 bit value).
                  X   - Set X register (16 bit value).
                  Y   - Set Y register (16 bit value).
                  U   - Set user stack pointer (16 bit value).
                  S   - Set system stack pointer (16 bit value).
                  P   - Set program counter (16 bit value).
                  sp  - (SPACE) Set D accumulator (16 bit value).

               CU <uart#> <address>

                     Changes the uart address assignments.  The uart  number
                  is  '1'  for the main console,  or  '2'  for the auxiliary
                  uart.  When a new  uart  address  is  assigned,  the  INIT
                  routine is automatically called to initialize the device.

               CV <vector> <address>

                     Changes the interrupt  vector  handler  addresses.  The
                  vectors are as follows:

                  1 or 'S' - SWI  (Software Interrupt) vector
                  2        - SWI2 (Software Interrupt 2) vector
                  3        - SWI3 (Software Interrupt 3) vector
                  4 or 'I' - IRQ  (Interrupt Request) vector
                  5 or 'F' - FIRQ (Fast Interrupt Request) vector

               DB

                  Displays the current breakpoint settings.

               DI <start>,<end>

                  Disassembles memory,  starting at  indicated  address.  If
                  SPACE  is  entered  for  <end>  address,   assumes   FFFF.
                  Disassembler output contains address, opcodes bytes, ASCII
                  equivalent of  opcode  bytes,  instruction  neumonic,  and
                  operands to instruction.

               DM <start>,<end>

                  Displays memory, in HEX/ASCII dump format, starting at the
                  indicated  address.  If  a  SPACE  is  entered  for  <end>
                  address, assumes FFFF.

               DR

                  Displays the values of the 6809 registers.

               DU

                  Displays the current uart address assignments.

               DV

                  Display the current interrupt vector address assignments.

               E <address>

                  Edit's memory,  Address and contents are displayed,  Enter
                  two hex digits to change value, or a single quote followed
                  by a character. Entering SPACE skips to the next location,
                  BACKSPACE  backups  to  the  previous  location.  CARRIAGE
                  RETURN terminates the edit command.

               FM <start>,<end> <value>

                  Fill's memory from <start> to <end> with the byte <value>.

               G <address>

                  Begins execution at the indicated address.  If a SPACE  is
                  entered instead of an address,  begins  execution  at  the
                  address in the saved 6809 program counter.

               L

                  Downloads data from the auxiliary port,  which may  be  in
                  either MOTOROLA or INTEL hex format.

               MM <start>,<end> <destination>

                  Move's memory  from  <start>  to  <end>,  placeing  it  at
                  <destination>.

               MT <start>,<end>

                  Performs a memory test on memory from  <start>  to  <end>.
                  Pass number is displayed,  First two digits indicate total
                  number completed tests,  last two digits indicate  current
                  pass  (value)  within the  test.  Each  value  is  written
                  sequentially to memory,  insuring that previous  data  has
                  not changed before the new value is written.  To exit  the
                  test, press the escape key.

               RR <address>

                  This command loops,  performing a read  of  the  specified
                  address until it is terminated by the escape key.

               RW <address> <value>

                  This  command  loops,  writing  the  given  value  to  the
                  specified address until it is  terminated  by  the  escape
                  key.

               S <address>

                  Begins single-stepping at  the  indicated  address.  If  a
                  SPACE is entered for  the  address,  then  single-stepping
                  begins at the address in the saved 6809  program  counter.
                  Disassembled instruction is displayed on the terminal, and
                  MON09 waits for a  key  to  be  pressed.  If  a  SPACE  is
                  entered,  steps to the next instruction.  CARRIAGE  RETURN
                  toggles the automatic display of registers.  '?'  displays
                  the register values, and escape terminates the single-step
                  command.

               T

                  Enters  transparent  communication  mode,   passing   data
                  between the terminal and  the  auxiliary  port.  Enter  an
                  ESCAPE to exit.

               W <address> <value>

                  Performs  a  single  write  of  the  given  value  to  the
                  specified address in memory.

               XR <address>

                  As 'RR' command, except that a 16 bit value is read.

               XW <address> <word value>

                  As 'RW' command, except that a 16 bit value is written.

               + <value>+<value>

                  Performs 16 bit addition of the values,  and displays  the
                  result.

               - <value>-<Value>

                  Performs 16 bit subtraction of the  values,  and  displays
                  the result.

               ?

                  Displays a short help summary of the commands.
    MON09                                                            Page: 6


       2.3 Display Output

             In order to maintain the maximum amount of data on the terminal
          screen during the debugging session,  MON09 has been  designed  to
          minimize the number of screen lines in any display.  All  commands
          which output only one line of data (such as 'DR' 'DV'), will do so
          on the same line on which the command is issued  (To the right  of
          the command).

             For commands which output larger amounts of data (such as 'DI',
          'DM),  pressing the SPACE key during the  display  will  halt  the
          display on the next line. Each subsequent SPACE entered will cause
          one more line of data be displayed.  Pressing CARRIAGE RETURN will
          allow the display to continue at full speed.

             The escape key may be used to cancel command output, and return
          to the '*' prompt.

       2.4 Breakpoints

             MON09 allows breakpoints to be  placed  in  the  program  under
          test, which when encountered during the execution of that program,
          cause the program to interrupt, and MON09 is entered. Up to 8 such
          breakpoints (numbered from 0 to 7) may be placed in the program at
          any one time.

             When entered from a breakpoint,  MON09  will  first  display  a
          message  indicating  the  number  of  the  breakpoint  which   was
          encountered,  followed by the  processor  registers,  after  which
          MON09 enters command mode.

             Once MON09 has been entered from a breakpoint, the registers of
          the program under test are saved.  Note that the  address  of  the
          breakpoint is in the saved 6809  program  counter,  and  therefore
          using a SPACE as the operand to a 'G'  or  'S'  command will allow
          execution or single stepping to continue from the breakpoint.

             Breakpoints are entirely transparent,  and will remain  in  the
          program until explicitly removed.

       2.5 Non-Maskable Interrupt

             Whenever  a  Non-Maskable  interrupt  occurs,  MON09   performs
          processing similar to that of a breakpoint.  A message  indicating
          NMI has occured is displayed, followed by the processor registers,
          after which MON09 enters command mode.

             Execution following NMI can be resumed by using a SPACE as  the
          operand to a 'G' or 'S' command, exactly as with a breakpoint.

       3.2 I/O Configuration Control Byte

             MON09 maintains a control byte,  which directs I/O to and  from
          the console and aux serial ports.  The definition of bits in  this
          byte is as follows:

         Bit#   7  - Indicates output is flow-controlled (Via SPACE).
              3-6  - Not used.
                2  - 1= Output to AUX port.
                1  - 1= Output to console.
                0  - 1= Input from console, 0=Input from AUX port.
