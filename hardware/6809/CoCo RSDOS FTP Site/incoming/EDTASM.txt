EDITOR

     Print - to screen & move cursor to indicated line
     
          P[m,[n]] no modifiers prints a screen of lines
          P# first line

          W[D/T] filename[.ext]   default extension is .ASM
               D - disk, T - tape  These modifiers removed
               in EDTASM6309; disk is forced.
     **   W# filename    save source without line numbers
     
     L load source code
     
          L[D/T][A] filename[.ext] A - will append to

     FCB/FDB                  accepts a single value
                              ** accepts many values, ex.

     $1234, $5678, $9abc
**   FCS                      same as fcc /is anyone out
ther/
                                            fcb $80+'e

     .EQU.
     ENDC                     terminates conditional
     expression
     OPT
          MC   list macro calls
          NOMC do not list macro calls
          MD   list macro definitions
          NOMD don't list
          MEX  list macro expansions
          NOMEX  don't list
          L    turn on listing
          NOL  turn off listing

MACROS

     MACRO     indicates start of macro
     ENDM      indicates end of macro
     \.letter       symbol for use within a macro; letter
     must be A-Z
     \number        value that must be loaded from macro
     call; 0-9-A-Z
     
     ex. if GRAPH is the name of a macro
     GRAPH #$F8,ABC where \0 is loaded with the numerical
     value $F8 and \1 is loaded with the     string "ABC"
**   special symbol in EDTASM6309
     letter@        a local symbol which is used outside
macros as \.letter is used inside macros.
               These are reset by an empty line of source
code, ex.

start     clra
a@   deca
     bne  a@

     clrb
a@   decb
     bne  a@

EDTASM6309 permits the use of lowercase text. In the case of
symbols, lowercase is distinct from uppercase; a@ does not
equal A@.
